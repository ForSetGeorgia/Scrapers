# VizHack 2018 Literacy Scraper
Use the sitemap files to scrape the data and then the procee_files script to clean and merge the data.

The get_pdfs script will download all issue PDFs that are listed in the merged csv files. Note - this is about 140 PDFs in total over 3GB in size. You can see these PDFs by going to https://press.vizhack.ge.
